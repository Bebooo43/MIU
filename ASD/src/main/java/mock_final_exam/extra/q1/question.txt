Imagine that we wish to add a generic Visitor to the Composite Pattern (assume Transparent design
which means both Composite and Leaf have to implement the accept method). Through this
method, we wish to achieve a flexible way to pass behavior to be applied to every member of the
aggregate in Composite (the technical term for it is: Internal Iterator).

1. a) Write a Visitor that would collect the elements of the composite tree
in a collection as it visits all the elements of the aggregate.
2. b) Using the above visitor in (a) and by applying it to the node in
question, you can easily obtain an Iterator to the sub-tree.
